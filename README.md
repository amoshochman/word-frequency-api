# Word Frequency Stats

### A web app built with Python and Flask for analyzing word statistics.

The app exposes two endpoints:

1. _/words (post)_ </br>
Call it with a string of comma-separated words in the body</br>

2. _/stats (get)_ </br>
It Returns stats about the frequency of the words received until this point in time:
top5 words (with their respective frequency) and both the minimum and median frequency among all words.

The code is written allowing for concurrency and expecting more POSTs than GETs.


**Instructions to run**</br>
You can either run gunicorn_start.sh or through the Dockerfile (don't forget to redirect to port 5000. That is, run for example "docker build -t freq ." and then "docker run -p 5000:5000 freq")

Implementation note:
For retrieving the top words, we use an additional list of size 5. 
This makes the POSTs slower by a constant time -as the size of this additional list is constant-. 
That is, we add the overhead of inserting to and removing from this additional list with the top words. 
On other hand, this way we make the GETs faster, as we'll always just retrieve the data from the short list, instead
of iterating over the whole data, which appears to be not bounded.
Being that the POSTs are supposed to be much more than the GETs, we'd need more information in order to take a wiser decision.
